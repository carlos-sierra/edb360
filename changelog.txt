v1620 (2016-11-23)
=====
1. SQLd360 stops executing when it consumed all the time allocated by eDB360 (the *next* SQL ID will be ignored, the current one is let to complete)
2. All queries on dba_hist_active_sesss_history are now decorated with hints to use FTS and HJ. This to provide more consistent and predictable execution times when ASH is not getting purged and stats are not up to date.
3. Added awr_ash_pre_check.sql and verify_stats_wr_sys.sql scripts. If eDB360 is expected to take more than 8 hours the execution stops and waits for conformation to proceed.
4. SQL Trace is back on for eDB360 so we get a tkprof for the execution of eDB360 itself.
